<!--Inside our views, we have access to one variable called Model. You only have one Model. You have to declare the TYPE (not the NAME) of the model at the top, such as what's shown on line 2.-->
<!--Once the model type is identified, you then have access to it (such as what's seen on lines 10-15)'-->
